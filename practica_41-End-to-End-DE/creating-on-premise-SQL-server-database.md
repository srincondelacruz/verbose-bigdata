# Creating the on-premise SQL server database

As a prerequisite we need to have SQL Server, SQL Server Managment Studio 20 and the AdventureWorks2017 bak file in our computer:

- [SQL Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2215158&clcid=0x40A&culture=es-es&country=es)
- [SQL Server Managment Studio 20](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup)
- [AdventureWorksLT2017.bak](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksLT2017.bak)

Once we have everything, the AdventureWorksLT2017.bak file has to be placed in the next directory:

```makefile
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup
```

1. Open  SQL Server Managment Studio 20
